# Deal-or-Smarter-Than-a-Millionaire-SpongeBob-Edition

About
-----

This is the web version of the SpongeBob edition of a fusion of
"Deal or No Deal", "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader", and
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire".
Besides the images, audio, and borrowed software, this game is
entirely be my work.

Regarding languages, I used HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

Regarding libraries, I used jQuery, AngularJS, and QUnit. The former
two libraries are included through CDNs (Content Delivery Networks),
whereas the latter library's two files are included in the repository.

Use of Git Hooks
----------------

To prevent trailing whitespace, I've enabled the pre-commit Git hook.
However, this change can't be saved in the repository. To make this
change, navigate to the directory .git/hooks, and rename "pre-commit.sample"
to "pre-commit".
