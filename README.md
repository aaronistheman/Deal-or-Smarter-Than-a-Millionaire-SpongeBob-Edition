# Deal-or-Smarter-Than-a-Millionaire-SpongeBob-Edition

About
-----

This is the web version of the SpongeBob edition of a fusion of
"Deal or No Deal", "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader", and
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire". I am currently working on it.
Besides the images, audio, and borrowed software, this game will
entirely be my work.

Use of Git Hooks
----------------

To prevent trailing whitespace, I've enabled the pre-commit Git hook.
However, this change can't be saved in the repository. To make this
change, navigate to the directory .git/hooks, and rename "pre-commit.sample"
to "pre-commit".

Acknowledgements
