Next:
-questions display
    --generate ten questions of different categories from a pool
    --display the questions' difficulty and subject on the
        questions display
    --a question can be emphasized
    --the user can change which one is emphasized
-picking a question
    --the user can pick
    --the question and options (i.e. remaining help and answers)
        are presented
-implement peeking
-implement ask the audience
-implement phone a friend
-implement saving
-implement losing (i.e. player answered the question incorrectly
    and wasn't saved) and leaving with nothing
-implement answering a question correctly and moving on
    --show case open with random money amount
        --show effect on money display
    --make sure used sources of help are not still available)
-banker makes a deal
    --user has two options
-after ten questions, user can leave with case or try to answer
    million dollar question

At some point:
-effects as canvases appear or disappear (e.g. fading)
    --and maybe even between speakers (could maybe hide and then show
        as a trick)
-look into that one error that always pops up in the console
-make class MoneyData?
    --this can be used to update both MoneyDisplay and
        BriefcaseDisplay
-either throw a class ParameterError to trigger that kind of exception,
    or make ParameterError a general error function
    --maybe decide on a better way of dealing with exceptions
    --alert for each exception
    --alert if missing object parameter
-again consider a developed QuoteBubble object
    --drawQuoteText() could stay in game-show-fusion.js (and either
        stand alone or be added to the prototype)
-generating script files to include in both index.html and
    unit-tests.html with AngularJS

After game is playable (or, perhaps, ready for release 0.1):
-maybe change some of host's quotes to make some of the game's
    weird parts less weird (e.g. the use of grades for the questions)
-better looking briefcases
-fake static advertisement panel on the side
    --could advertise some of my YouTube videos
-more decorated main menu
-a guide to each assistant that can be unlocked by reaching a certain
 high score (using local storage); link in introduction

Before release 0.1:
-make sure trivial functions that are no longer needed and that were
 made for the purpose of testing have been erased
-erase commented out methods of MoneyDisplay
-update readme
-put release number on each file
-YouTube video; put link in readme

Considerable:
-making the game work on Safari 5 for Windows
-put truly private and priviledged members/functions in classes
-CSS classes for manipulating the color of the background of certain
    canvases
-improve the fitting of a quote into its bubble
    --find a way to properly limit a line in a quote
        --try measuring something other than number of characters
        --or find a way to make each character take up same space
    --find a way to deal with splitting a word between lines (besides
    having to put extra whitespace)
        --could limit quotes to one line
        --could split each string/quote into array of words (separate
            by ' ')
-load question data (e.g. with jQuery AJAX)

Question categories:
-video games
-crime (e.g. Bubble Buddy high tide, Plankton, the strangler)
-geography
-staff
-restaurants
-vehicles
-side characters
-main characters
-art
-driving
-fitness
-rumors (e.g. hash slinging slasher, creepypasta)
-history
-technology (Robo Krabs)
-quotations
