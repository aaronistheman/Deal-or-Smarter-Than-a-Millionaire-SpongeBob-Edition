Next:
-put in readme how to run unit tests
-store canvases and contexts in their own object(s)
    --make cleanQuotes() more efficient and used in drawTextPieces()
-change the name of the menu to the title screen
-consider making another attempt at drawQuotes()
    --try using the number of quotes in a better way for iteration
-(It seems that the game can be made in any order, so...)
 provide the ability to flow from scene to scene
    --present one question and one money amount?
    --initialize game by randomly picking questions and money amounts?

At some point:
-more decorated main menu
-make sure trivial functions that are no longer needed and that were
 made for the purpose of testing have been erased

Ideas for millionaires to be able to choose as assistants:
-Kevin O'Leary ("Mr. Wonderful")
-Mr. Burns
-Mr. Krabs

Consider:
-making an object for a state stack
-making the game work on Safari 5 for Windows
