Next:
-implement phone a friend
    --after "phone a friend" button is clicked:
        --determine Patrick's answer
        --play different music as host explains what'll happen
        --play different music during the call
        --show Patrick and the quote bubble; have Patrick speak, originally
        mistaking you for Mario; have Patrick say his answer; don't
        show any timer
        --play time out sound effect after certain number of quote
        bubbles
        --have the host thank Patrick
        --fix the music and show the question and answer rectangles again;
        enable user input
-implement saving
    --make sure it isn't used in million dollar question; could edit
    removeAllLifelines()
-say correct answer letter if wrong answer is picked
-once peeking and saving are no longer possible, set current helper
to null and don't allow picking of anymore helpers
    --make SpongeBob explain this
-make sure:
    --SpongeBob explains the controls for using a source of help
    --sources of help can only be used once (esp. saving)
    --sources of help can't be used on million dollar question
-put more to the ending? perhaps some graphical thing or words
    "The End"
    --EndGame class?
        --could pass the context (i.e. the type of ending) to get
            the appropriate reaction, thus making it more manageable, too
            (look below for list of endings)
    --play closing theme in all endings
    --individually examine each of the five endings: (e.g. quotes, music)
        --lose one of first ten questions
        --take deal
        --take case home
        --lose on million dollar question
        --win a million
-more decorated title screen
    --will probably have to implement image preloading
	--disclaim that SpongeBob or any of the involved game shows are
        at all my possession

Before release 0.1:
-make sure trivial functions that are no longer needed and that were
 made for the purpose of testing have been erased in game-show-fusion.js
-make sure readme's number of questions is correct
-put release number on each file

After release 0.1:
-applause sound effect
-look into that one error that always pops up in the console
(for index.html)
-consider making my own graphics for some things (e.g. briefcases)
    --could use GIMP, Microsoft Word, etc.
    --in this case, consider resource identifiers for the images
-with WebGL:
    --show opening of briefcase with WebGL
    --show visual briefcase when determining if user took good deal
    --show updating of money display with WebGL
    --use WebGL to present banker's offer with a rotating rectangle
    --if I decide not to use WebGL, alternative must be used
        (e.g. 2d drawing)
-make sure the game progresses smoothly in all parts (e.g. visually
    and auditorially)

After final release (whatever that turns out to be):
-YouTube video; put link in readme
    --menion secret title screen cheat codes

Considerable:
-unit test to check sufficient subject variety
-adjust banker multiplier based on certain factors
    --e.g. grades of the answered questions
    --multiplier could be adjusted randomly within a range
-something unique in situations that would cause a really low bank offer
    --e.g. currently, having only 0.01 and 50 left leads to offer of $0
-putting something (e.g. game logo) in a blank banker offer bar
-improving the timing of the good offer sound (that is, show the money
    display during the "dink" part of the sound)
    --would require setTimeout() for the drawing of the offer
-hidden Saw music/visuals mode
-image preloading
    --sound preloading, too? (is this necessary or even a thing?)
-make way to disable questions about "modern" SpongeBob
    --e.g. pressing the down arrow three times in the title screen
        --announce how to do it in the YouTube video's ending
    --make sure the minimum question spread is met
    --for each question about "modern" SpongeBob, make a question
        of the same subject and grade about old SpongeBob
-having the order of the answers be randomized
    --could have object prototype Answer with member isCorrect
    --for Question constructor, the first answer given is made into
        the correct one; each is made into Answer object (out of the
        given AnswerData object)
-consider somehow changing the answer rectangle that the lifeline
    has chosen (but don't do this if it's too hard; it's my fault for
    not planning ahead enough); for terminology's sake, let's
    call such a rectangle a "favored" answer rectangle
