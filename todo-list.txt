Next:
-get the banker's offer working
    --put comma as separator in the offer; make a function, test it,
        and put it in utility.js
    --user has two options
    --if user takes the deal, have host say whether or not the
        deal was good and conclude game
    --if user rejects the deal, have game continue
        --make sure the background music changes back from the banker
            music
    --play appropriate sound effects when accept or reject deal
-effects as canvases appear or disappear (e.g. fading)
    --could be issue if a canvas is hidden and redrawn (as occurs
        to the quote bubble frequently in rules explanation)
	--to resolve this issue, could only apply the fading effect
		to certain canvases (e.g. not the quote bubble),
		or could edit CanvasStack to ignore repeats
    --and maybe even between speakers (could maybe hide and then show
        as a trick)
-display the banker's offer along with the other monetary amounts
    --could convert the money display into this
-allow picking of a helper
-make separate canvas for help options
-implement peeking
-implement ask the audience
-implement phone a friend
-implement saving
-make sure:
    --SpongeBob explains the controls for using a source of help
    --sources of help can only be used once
    --sources of help can't be used on million dollar question
-put more to the ending? perhaps some graphical thing or words
    "The End"
    --EndGame class?
        --could pass the context (i.e. the type of ending) to get
            the appropriate reaction
    --play closing theme in all endings
    --individually examine each of the five endings: (e.g. quotes, music)
        --lose one of first ten questions
        --take deal
        --take case home
        --lose on million dollar question
        --win a million

At some point:
-add more first and second grade questions
-fix SpongeBob's directions about arrow keys and choosing question
    --make sure the introductory directions are all correct
-look into that one error that always pops up in the console
-make SpongeBob do dramatic pauses before announcing every answer
-with WebGL:
    --show opening of briefcase with WebGL
    --show updating of money display with WebGL
    --use WebGL to present banker's offer with a rotating rectangle
    --if I decide not to use WebGL, alternative must be used
        (e.g. 2d drawing)
-more decorated title screen
-consider making my own graphics for some things (e.g. briefcases)
    --could use GIMP, Microsoft Word, etc.
    --in this case, consider resource identifiers for the images

Before release 0.1:
-make sure trivial functions that are no longer needed and that were
 made for the purpose of testing have been erased in game-show-fusion.js
-erase commented out methods of MoneyDisplay (around lines 96-99)
-update readme
-put release number on each file

After release 0.1:
-Facebook/Twitter integration
-YouTube video; put link in readme

Considerable:
-making the game work on Safari 5 for Windows
-put truly private and priviledged members/functions in classes
-CSS classes for manipulating the color of the background of certain
    canvases
-use more web fonts
-low volume coughing if a certain answer is highlighted (as a
    reference to the fraud in Who Wants to be a Millionaire)
-separating Questions into three classes: Questions, QuestionsLabelDisplay,
    QuestioningDisplay
-allowing up/down keys to be used in choosing briefcase
    --ensure that SpongeBob explains this
-attaching the playing of sound effects to the class methods (e.g.
    BriefcaseDisplay::EmphasizePreviousCase())
    --this was already done with drawQuoteText()
-moving quote bubble code into its own file
-(if can still make a difference) applying isUnitTesting() when
    drawing question labels, so that they won't be drawn if
    unit testing; could apply to drawLabel functions
-unit test to check sufficient subject variety
-replace use of ParameterError() with an alert and the throwing
    of an unhandled exception
    --update affected functions' contracts
-for functions that emphasize things, don't erase and redraw if same thing
    is emphasized
-make class MoneyData
    --this can be used to update both MoneyDisplay and
        BriefcaseDisplay
