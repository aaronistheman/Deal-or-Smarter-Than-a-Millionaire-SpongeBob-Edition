Next:
-show canvases that should be shown during introduction (or basic
    versions of them)
-introduce helpers
-start working on questions display, randomization, topics, and
    appropriate objects

At some point:
-find a better way to edit CanvasStack in the middle of quote chain
-look into that one error that always pops up in the console
-make class MoneyData?
    --this can be used to update both MoneyDisplay and
        BriefcaseDisplay
-either throw a class ParameterError to trigger that kind of exception,
    or make ParameterError a general error function
    --maybe decide on a better way of dealing with exceptions
    --alert for each exception
    --alert if missing object parameter
-again consider a developed QuoteBubble object
    --drawQuoteText() could stay in game-show-fusion.js (and either
        stand alone or be added to the prototype)
    --generating script files to include in both index.html and
        unit-tests.html with AngularJS
-improve the fitting of a quote into its bubble
    --find a way to properly limit a line in a quote
        --try measuring something other than number of characters
        --or find a way to make each character take up same space
    --find a way to deal with splitting a word between lines (besides
    having to put extra whitespace)
        --could limit quotes to one line
        --could split each string/quote into array of words (separate
            by ' ')

After game is playable (or, perhaps, ready for release 0.1):
-better looking briefcases
-fake non-static advertisement panel on the side
    --could advertise some of my YouTube videos
-more decorated main menu
-a guide to each assistant that can be unlocked by reaching a certain
 high score (using local storage); link in introduction

Before release 0.1:
-make sure trivial functions that are no longer needed and that were
 made for the purpose of testing have been erased
-erase commented out methods of MoneyDisplay
-update readme
-put release number on each file
-YouTube video; put link in readme

Considerable:
-making the game work on Safari 5 for Windows
-having a global variable for each canvas
-if multiple toggles, make something to generate the layout of a
 toggle function (e.g. including the check of precondition error)
-generating proper file header in add-file script
-put truly private and priviledged members/functions in classes
-disabling the ability of the user to hold Enter to rush through the
 quotes (to prevent accidents, although disabling this feature prevents
 players from controlling their gameplay speed)
    --this could be fixed with one second delay between setting enter
      action
-effects as canvases appear or disappear
-CSS classes for manipulating the color of the background of certain
    canvases

Ideas for millionaires to be able to choose as assistants:
-Kevin O'Leary ("Mr. Wonderful")
-Mr. Burns

Game flow:
-host introduces himself and game
-host shows you the Deal or No Deal money screen
-host explains the rules
    --you pick a case
    --you pick a question and try to answer it
    --each correct answer leads to a case with a random money amount
      being opened
    --after every two questions, the banker (Mr. Krabs) makes a deal
    --if you miss a question and are not saved, you leave with nothing
    --if you get past all ten questions, you have the option of either
        taking your case home or going for the million dollar question
-host says you do have help
    --host introduces five helpers who can save you or let you cheat
        --introduce helpers
    --host tells you of two lifelines (ask audience and phone a friend)
        --phoning a friend cuts to Patrick asking if its Pizza Castle
    --these don't work on million dollar question
-you pick your case
-host shows you the randomly generated question screen
