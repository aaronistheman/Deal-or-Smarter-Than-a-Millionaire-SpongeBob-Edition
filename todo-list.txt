Next:
-in name of functions that call eraseQuoteBubble(), put the word "erase"
 and (if necessary) split into helper functions
-(It seems that the game can be made in any order, so...)
 provide the ability to flow from scene to scene
    --present one question and one money amount?
    --initialize game by randomly picking questions and money amounts?

At some point:
-more decorated main menu
-make sure trivial functions that are no longer needed and that were
 made for the purpose of testing have been erased
-a guide to each assistant that can be unlocked by reaching a certain
 high score (using local storage)

Ideas for millionaires to be able to choose as assistants:
-Kevin O'Leary ("Mr. Wonderful")
-Mr. Burns
-Mr. Krabs

Consider:
-making an object for a state stack
-making the game work on Safari 5 for Windows
-having a global variable for each canvas
