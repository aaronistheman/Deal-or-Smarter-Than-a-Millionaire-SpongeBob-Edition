Next:
-create screen with each money amount in Deal or No Deal style
    --make the host say something about it
-consider playing music in the host's introduction
-turn quote bubble into an object (QuoteBubble)
-show case display for explaining next part of rules
-make a state stack (that is, a canvas stack) object (if necessary)
    --to control showing and hiding canvases better
    --in its initialization, it'll show what need be shown

At some point:
-more decorated main menu
-make sure trivial functions that are no longer needed and that were
 made for the purpose of testing have been erased
-a guide to each assistant that can be unlocked by reaching a certain
 high score (using local storage); link in introduction
-put private and priviledged members in classes

Ideas for millionaires to be able to choose as assistants:
-Kevin O'Leary ("Mr. Wonderful")
-Mr. Burns

Consider:
-making an object for a state stack
-making the game work on Safari 5 for Windows
-having a global variable for each canvas
-disabling the ability of the user to hold Enter to rush through the
 quotes (to prevent accidents, although disabling this feature prevents
 players from controlling their gameplay speed)
-separating classes/objects into different files (see if this is good)

Game flow:
-host introduces himself and game
-host shows you the Deal or No Deal money screen
-host explains the rules
    --you pick a case
    --you pick a question and try to answer it
    --each correct answer leads to a case with a random money amount
      being opened
    --after every two questions, the banker (Mr. Krabs) makes a deal
    --if you miss a question and are not saved, you leave with nothing
    --if you get past all ten questions, you have the option of either
        taking your case home or going for the million dollar question
-host says you do have help
    --host introduces five helpers who can save you or let you cheat
    --host tells you of two lifelines (ask audience and phone a friend)
        --phoning a friend cuts to Patrick asking if its Pizza Castle
-you pick your case
-host shows you the randomly generated question screen
